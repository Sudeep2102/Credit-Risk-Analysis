# Credit-Risk-Analysis

A borrower's default on a loan and loss of principal and interest are examples of credit risk. Banks evaluate loan applications and may reject loan applications from borrowers who are at risk of financial loss due to poor credit. The aim of this project is to create a forecast model using a data set of loan applications to evaluate loan acceptance based on the applicant profile.
